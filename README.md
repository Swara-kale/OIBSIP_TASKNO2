Car Price Prediction

Description:
This project predicts the selling price of cars based on features such as market price, mileage, fuel type, selling type, and transmission. Using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, the model provides accurate price estimates and highlights key factors influencing car value.

Key Features:

1.Data preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding).

2.Predictive modeling with Linear and Lasso Regression.

3.Model evaluation using metrics like MSE and RÂ².

4.Visualization of data

Model Training:

Linear Regression:
A simple regression technique that fits a straight line to the data, predicting the selling price as a linear function of the given features.

Lasso Regression:
A regularized version of linear regression using L1 regularization, which helps reduce overfitting and eliminates less important features by shrinking their coefficients to zero.
